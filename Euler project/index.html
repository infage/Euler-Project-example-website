    <h3>Problem 1</h3>
    <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
      we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
    <p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

    <h3>Problem 2</h3>
    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
      previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
      be:</p>
    <p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
      exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
